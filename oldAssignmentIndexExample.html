				<section style="text-align: left">
					Understanding the terms and what they mean is a good start on our way to understanding what they will entail. Here are some basic definitions to get us started:<br><br><br>
					<h5 style="margin-left: 70px">Making</h5>
					<li class="fragment" style="margin-left: 70px"><em>The act or process of forming, causing, doing, or coming into being.</em></li><br><br>

					<li class="fragment" style="margin-left: 70px"><em>The action of making or manufacturing from components or raw materials, or the process of being so manufactured.</em></li><br><br>
					<span class="fragment">These terms all mean quite similar things. They're getting at the process of creation of a thing and/or translation of a non-physical thing into a physical state.

							Looking through history, most people wanted to make their own things, or at least it was quite common to know the person making the thing you wanted.
							Things that were made were largely utility based, and only made by others when economically viable and important.
							Custom things was the norm, as making a lot of the one thing wasn't all too much easier than making just one<sup>1</sup>.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							Fast forward through most<sup>2</sup> of history to the first industrial revolution, and automation of making really came to fruition, first through textiles.
							The second industrial revolution came, and factories were everywhere - the rural life was starting to see a real decline, especially as goods could be transported across the country on long distance steam trains.
							During these two revolutions, making one thing many many times became a lot easier, but making many different things was still difficult.
							Variety of industrial design was low as economies of scale dominated any need for personalisation<sup>3</sup>.

						The third industrial revolution is really the one that we largely feel the effects of<sup>4</sup>.
						Electronic and IT systems greatly increased the ability of automation and computation, which further aided the reduction of costs in manufacturing.
						The automation of the creation of complex devices such as the personal computer (PC) was advancing at an impressively fast pace<sup>5</sup>, but the manufacturing of personalised items was still quite low.
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							This did come with a caveat however, and that was that a new category of 'making' had been formed - software.
							Software was a way of customising the functionality of a hardware device, and was easily personalisable.
							The same constraints that applied to hardware construction didn't apply to software.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							Cue the introduction of the internet, and the distribution of personalised interaction experiences with internet-capable devices becomes easy in a way that has never been seen before.
							Software did have its limitations however - it was constricted to the capabilities presented to it by the hardware.
							Applications, operating systems, websites and so on were powerful and increasing in capabilities rapidly, but usually constricted to rectangular screens<sup>6</sup>.

						But for the most part, screens.
						It comes back to the issue of non-customisable hardware, building in capability for the use of a vibrating chair only services the limited amount of people with that expensive vibrating chair.

						The advent of industry 4.0 has meant that there's a change in the way that we can approach personalising objects.
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							Technologies such as 3D printing <sup>7</sup> are enabling the use of computation technologies to produce objects custom designed by users without extensive setup costs.
							The internet exposed the ability to be able to communicate larger and larger amounts of data between individuals, and software has been advanced to the point that the barrier to entry of object design is achieveable.
							As time goes on & the community of personalised makers persists, these making machines will likely take the same route as the personalised computer and moore's law - they will become better, cheaper, and more ubiquitous<sup>8</sup>.

						<sup>7</sup>Other examples include laser cutting, CNC cutting, and robotic arm use with custom end effectors, among other things. 
						Largely they fall into two categories - additive & subtractive manufacturing. 
						<br><br>
						<sup>8</sup>The hype for 3D printing in particular fluctuates dramatically (like VR),

						At the very least, more than before.
						The obvious ones that come to mind are businesses that are specifically fabrication specialists & consultancies<sup>9</sup>.
						Secondary & tertiary education institutions that educate students on how to fabricate things fall closely behind, but even those that don't have a specific focus on making/fabricating/production will likely have some use for object creation.

							Built Environment companies find use for them in producing both prototypes and scale models for various projects, as do engineering firms.

						<span class="fragment">
							Currently, not many firms utilise these capabilities, but if we were to draw a parallel between the internet's spread and that of personalised manufacturing<sup>11</sup>, a large rise in the ubiquity and uses of personalised manufacturing will likely occur, with a great range of previously unexpected implications on many industries.

					<h4>What actually are the implications on these spaces?</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-background-transition="slide" data-background-color="#FFF" style="color:#000">
					<section>
						Firstly, thinking about dedicated spaces.
						Traditionally, maker spaces have a wide variety of powerful tools for use by trained professionals, who cut, glue, nail, & sand (and so on) to specifications they know.
						In new maker spaces, knowledge of the design specifications will increasingly be transmitted digitally, so tools will have a greater understanding of the end product, and thus less human interaction will be necessary<sup>12</sup>.
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							This will require a greater amount of electronic componentry, which is more likely to be affected by rogue particles of matter - the spaces should be cleaner <sup>13</sup>.
							On the other hand, the fact that these tools have a greater understanding of their own tasks and thus require less human interaction means that they are more easily self contained while in use, producing less sparks/dust/etc and can be less loud.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							Being self contained also means that they will be more easily replaceable and dynamically placeable.
							This will be necessary as the nature of a lot of these spaces will be rapid evolution due to exponential increases in the capabilites of technology and the nature of the needs of prototyping.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							The transmission of the data for these pieces of technology will also mean that greater amounts of cabling will be necessary in these spaces.
							Not only will there be potentially greater data transfer requirments, but also varying power cables will be necessary, as well as provisions for wireless data transfer (wifi, 5g, bluetooth, etc).
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							These provisions for wireless data transfer may cause us to start to think differently about the way that we make spaces especially.
						</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						<sup>12</sup>This is not to say that human input will approach only button pressing.
						There has been significant research recently into how humans and robots can collaborate on fabrication, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957415818300321">see this paper for example</a>.
						Humans are still a lot smarter than robots, and our fine motor skills are amazing.
						<br><br>
						<sup>13</sup> Dust and other particles at the very least block up fans and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/126956/can-dust-actually-damage-my-computer/">cause computers to over-heat</a>.
						In maker spaces especially though, conductive particles (e.g. from cutting metal) can cause more severe damage by short circuiting chips among other things.

						Walls don't just provide structural support for roofs, they also provide intentional seperation between spaces for various reasons - two pertinent examples being privacy and noise (both visual and auditory).
						As the digital landscape becomes more and more 'noisey' with lots of wireless connections, walls could serve a similar purpose in blocking these signals.
						This is especially important in a space for potentially fabricating new devices that haven't been as rigorously designed to compete with various other wireless connections in the 'real' world.
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							Faraday cage technology<sup>14</sup> can be used for this purpose, blocking electromagnetic waves - stopping things like wifi, bluetooth & so on from passing through.
							Temporary moveable faraday-caged walls could even be set up to allow seperate sub-spaces to be free of wireless interaction from each other.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="fragment">
							This blocking of wireless connections will generate its own set of problems however - wired connections are needed to transmit data, at least moreso than being entirely wireless.
							Since, as discussed earlier, technology should be able to be dynamically placed and replaced, spaces should provide a system for non-obtrusively providing the necessary data and power cabling necessary.
							BVN, an Australian architecture firm, has developed a system that allows for this kind of manipulation for the placement of desks within its office<sup>15</sup>.
						</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						<sup>14</sup>That's a fancy way of putting it, really a faraday cage is <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/how-does-a-faraday-cage-work">just a metal screen</a>.
						Different metal screen designs have <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/chapman_hewett_trefethen.pdf">slightly different properties</a> to be fair, but nothing too crazy.
						<br><br>
						<sup>15</sup><a href="http://www.bvn.com.au/2019/02/11/desks-move-suitable-case-social-contagion/">Here is an article</a> by BVN that describes the system.
						It definitely has some limitations (requires an 'octopus' that attaches to specific desks), but it's a good stepping stone in the direction of truly dynamic spaces.

						In reality, these spaces won't change all too much - old tools won't be replaced for quite some time, if ever.
						Dedicated making/fabricating/production spaces will still characteristically need high roofs, hard flooring, good noise insulation, good ventilation, ducting systems, extensive safety mechanisms and so on.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background-transition="slide" data-background-color="#FFF" style="color:#000">
					Really what will change are the mixed use spaces that were talked about before - spaces that aren't currently considered making/fabricating/production spaces.
					<br><br>
					<span class="fragment">
						These sub-spaces will likely have a greater (if not full) focus on personalised manufacturing technologies, as specialist knowledge of fabrication techniques will be lower, and knowledge-based activities will generally be higher.
						In reality these sub-spaces for making/fabricating/production will have quite similar requirements to dedicated spaces - dynamic rearrangement while maintaining data & power, faraday caged spaces (when required), effective ducting systems, hard flooring, etc.
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class="fragment">
						Another capability that may be required is the ability to stabilise these machines - often requiring high accuracy of three-dimensional movement by a head piece of some sort over extended periods of time, a bump or movement can ruin a piece of work.
						This would be especially helpful in a mixed use space as there will likely be more people who have less experience dealing with these kinds of machines in the space, and thus a higher likelihood of an accident occuring.
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class="fragment">
						In reality, these spaces won't be comprehensive for the making/fabricating/production of things.
						They're something quite closeby for the immediate needs of a business in the future.
						More dedicated spaces will always be necessary, and the easier they are to access the better.
